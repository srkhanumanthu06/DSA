3 PROBLEMS

1. Intersection of Two Arrays

2. Missing Number

3. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

QUESTION 1: Intersection of two arrays

Problem: Leetcode-349

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.

QUESTION 2: Missing number

Problem: Leetcode 268

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

Output: 8

Explanation:

n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

QUESTION 3: Find all numbers disapperaed in a array

Problem: Leetcode 448

Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [2]
